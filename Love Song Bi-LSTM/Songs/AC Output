I handle the loneliness I feel when you're not around, believing in my kind of soul. I'll do whatever it takes for you to stay. Handle me, handle them, we all need her no matter what time does. Don't do this because you love me; rather fall apart and let's handle this reality together. Let's trust in our memories and let them guide us on how to win love back again. You are like a vast ocean of love amidst a dry canyon - someone who can handle any kind of pain or cut and still remain so high. Let's see nothing ever defeats love.
