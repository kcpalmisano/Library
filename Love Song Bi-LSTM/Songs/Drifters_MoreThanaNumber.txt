You're more than a number in my little red book,
you're more than a one night date,
All it had to take me was just one look,
My heart began a thumpin',
Babe you had it jumpin',
Cause' you're more than a number in my little red book,
You're more than a one night stand,
In case you get to thinkin' that you'd been took,
You're more than a number,
Written in my little red book.
Oh baby give us a chance,
Don't let the small town rumours
end our first real romance,
Now I admit I've loved a few,
But there was never one like you,
So darlin', don't believe the things that they say.
You're more than a number in my little red book,
You're more than a one night date,
All it had to take me was just one look,
My heart began a thumpin',
Babe you had it jumpin',
Cause' you're more than a number in my little red book,
You're more than a one night stand,
In case you get to thinkin' that you'd been took,
You're more than a number,
Written in my little red book.
Oh baby,
You gave me a sign,
I threw away the numbers
of those old flames of mine,
And now they're tryin' to put you whilst,
Knock me down in my girls eyes,
Oh darlin', don't believe the words that they say.
You're more than a number in my little red book,
You're more than a one night date,
All it had to take me was just one look,
My heart began a thumpin',
Babe you had it jumpin',
Cause' you're more than a number in my little red book,
You're more than a one night stand,
In case you get to thinkin' that you'd been took,
You're more than a number,
Written in my little red book.
You're more than a number in my little red book,
You're more than a one night date,
All it had to take me was just one look,
My heart began a thumpin',
Babe you had it jumpin',
Cause' you're more than a number in my little red book,
You're more than a one night stand,
In case you get to thinkin' that you'd been took,
You're more than a number,
Written in my little red book.
