Come to my house tonight
We can be together in the nuclear sky
And we will dance in the poison rain
And we can stay a while in Heaven today
Let's stay together
Let's stay, these days are ours
Let's die together?
Two hearts under the skyscrapers
There's a time bomb in the high rise
There's a blue suburban dream
Will I see you up in paradise
Or have you come to catch me?
Come to my arms tonight
Just you and me together under electric light
And she will dance in the poison air
And we can stay together
Two hearts under the skyscrapers
There's a time bomb in the high rise
There's a blue suburban dream
Will I see you up in Paradise
Or have you come to catch me?
Come to my arms I'm lost
Just you and me together in the year of the horse
Single file in the nuclear night
And we could feel a little closer
As we tumble through the sky
Let's stay together,
let's stay these days are ours
