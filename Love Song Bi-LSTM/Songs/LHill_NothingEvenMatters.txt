Now the skies could fall
Not even if my boss should call
The world it seems so very small
Cause nothing even matters, at all
See nothing even matters at all
Nothing even matters at all
See I don't need no alcohol
Your love makes me feel ten feet tall
Without it I'd go through withdrawal
Cause nothing even matters, at all
Nothing even matters at all
These buildings could drift out to sea
Some natural catastrophe
Still there's no place I'd rather be
Cause nothing even matters to me
See nothing even matters to me
Nothing even matters to me
You're part of my identity
I sometimes have a tendency
To look at you religiously
Cause nothing even matters, to me
Nothing even matters
Said it don't matter, baby 
Don't matter
Now you won't find me at no store
I have no time for manicures
With you it's never either or
Cause nothing even matters, no more
See nothing even matters no more
Nothing even matters no more
Now my team could score
And make it to the Final Four
Just repossessed my four by four
Cause nothing even matters, no more
Nothing even matters no more
No no more
To me
