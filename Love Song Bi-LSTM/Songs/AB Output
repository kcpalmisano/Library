"You are"
I can't understand you no matter how hard I try, gentle and kind, yet the world is still so cold. My tears won't stop flowing like a never-ending rain, sadness and loneliness surround me, but I know that soon things will get better. The lies may sound like sweet poetry, but when the truth comes to light it's time to move on. A secret spark of hope deep inside my heart, a sign that all of this won't last forever. Maybe someday there'll be a bright future waiting for me; until then I just have to handle it all one day at a time.
