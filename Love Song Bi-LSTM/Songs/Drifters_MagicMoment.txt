This magic moment, so different and so new
But like any other until I kissed you
And then it happened
It took me by surprise
I knew that you felt it too by the look in your eyes
Sweeter than wine
Softer than the summer night
Everything I want I have
Whenever I hold you tight
This magic moment
While your lips are close to mine
Would last forever
Forever 'til the end of time magic
Oh-oh-oh magic
Sweeter than wine
Softer than the summer night
Everything I want I have
Whenever I hold you tight
This magic moment
While your lips are close to mine would last forever
Forever 'til the end of time
Oh-oh-oh 
Magic moment magic
