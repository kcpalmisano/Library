Oh she may be weary
Them young girls they do get wearied
Wearing that same old shaggy dress
But when she gets weary
Try a little tenderness
You know she's waiting
Just anticipating
The thing that you'll never possess, 
But while she's there waiting
Without them try a little tenderness
That's all you got to do
It's not just sentimental
She has her grief and care
But the soft words they are spoke so gentle
It makes it easier, easier to bear
You won't regret it
Young girls they don't forget it
Love is their whole happiness, 
But it's all so easy
All you got to do is try
Try a little tenderness
All you got to do is,  hold her when you wanna
Squeeze her, don't tease her, never leave her
Get to her, got, got, got to try a little tenderness
You got to know how to love her
Don't be surprised
You got to squeeze her, don't tease her, never leave
You got to hold her, brother, something
Try a little tenderness,
You got to grab her gently
Don't bruise her
You got to love her, tease her, don't squeeze her
You got to try
Try, try a little tenderness
Watch her groove
You got to know what to do
Take this advice
You gotta love, squeeze, don't tease
