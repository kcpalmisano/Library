I'm not a woman
I'm not a man
I am something that you'll never understand
I'll never beat you
I'll never lie
And if you're evil I'll forgive you by and by, 'cause
You, I would die for you, yeah
Darling, if you want me too
You, I would die for you
I'm not your lover
I'm not your friend
I am something that you'll never comprehend
No need to worry
No need to cry
I'm your messiah and you're the reason why, 'cause
You, I would die for you, yeah
Darling, if you want me too
I would die for you
You're just a sinner, I am told
Be your fire when you're cold
Make you happy when you're sad
Make you good when you are bad
I'm not a human
I am a dove
I'm your conscious
I am love
All I really need is to know that you believe
Yeah, I would die for you, yeah
Darling, if you want me too
I would die for you
