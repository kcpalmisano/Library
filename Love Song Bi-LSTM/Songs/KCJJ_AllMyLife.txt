I'm so glad
I will never find another lover
Sweeter than you
And I will never find another lover
More precious than you
Girl you are
Close to me you're like my mother
Close to me you're like my father
Close to me you're like my sister
Close to me you're like my brother
And you are the only one, my everything
And for you this song I sing
All my life
I prayed for someone like you
And I thank God
That I finally found you
And I hope that you feel the same way too
Yes, I pray that you do love me too
I'd so thankful that I'm thinking of
Said I promise to never fall in love
With a stranger
You're all I'm thinking of
I praise the Lord above
For sending me your love
I cherish every hug
I really love you
All my life 
I prayed for someone like you
And I thank God
That I finally found you
And I hope that you feel the same way too
Yes, I pray that you do love me too
You're all that I've ever know
When you smile all my face always seems to glow
You turned my life around
You picked me up when I was down
You're all that I've ever known
When you smile my face glows
You picked me up when I was down
Say, you're all that I've ever known
When you smile my face glows
You picked me up when I was down
And I hope that you
Feel the same way too
Yes, I pray that you do love me too
All my life
I prayed for someone like you
And I thank God
That I finally found you
