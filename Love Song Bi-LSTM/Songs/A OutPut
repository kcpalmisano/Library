"Snow"
The power of love is a curious thing, it's strong yet delicate at the same time. It can make a person wild and free, yet also handle them with tenderness and care. The light that it brings illuminates our darkest moments and memories, guiding us on our journey to trust, luck, friendship and love. Tonight I will speak words of my own with my mouth and make a deal with the universe: I'll give my light to everyone in the crowd and together we can create something brighter and better than any one of us could do alone. Defying all odds, my loving hand reaches out across the sea in search of those who share my passion for life and joy in love. And when I look into their eyes I know they won't ever leave me; no matter what may come, we'll always be together.
