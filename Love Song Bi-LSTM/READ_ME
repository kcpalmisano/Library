This was a story of a girl...

Is it not always about a girl? Okay so I had a then girlfriend, now finacee that I wanted to impress. 
She enjoyed when I wrote her small poetry, (and this is before ChatGPT!!) so I thought it might be fun to take the "top" love songs and have AI help me write out something. 

I thought a bi-directional LSTM would be a good way to do it to help with more meaning as it can provide a richer understanding of the context surrounding each word in a sequence.
It adds layers to better determine context, grammatical function of a word, and nuanced sentiment. 

I trained it on a very small data set of 'love' songs that were listed as being a "top love song" from various websites. The songs were modified for nonsense words and other oddities/slang. 
("lil" , "ooooo", "ah", etc.) Later repeating words were removed as well ("Peaches", "Shivers", etc.)

It produced moderately decent outputs but would often start repeating, so the repeating words were removed and attempts were made again. It worked and produced viable output
but still requires significantly additional materials to effectively produce actionable outputs. When pushed through an type of interupreter (another form of AI designed to help write out 
fully developed concepts) the output was quite reasonable and produced good results.
