The bari_build was the background work that lead to the bariatric model. 
The model goal is to predict members that would be appropriate for the Bariatric program. 
The model is to run against daily incoming claims and provide members for outreach on their enrollment into the program. 
Bariatric requirements were provided by the business. 

The model was eventually used in a cloud deployment but for testing purposes and POC a pickle was used to call the 
model against the data.
