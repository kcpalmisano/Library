As a project I started the inital analysis on the Kaggle competition for NFL Big Data Bowl 2025. 
Had a weekend and a day to really work on this. This is ONLY A START! I do not even get into the 'good' data, the tracking data. 
I feel like it is a good start on the player and game data, but definitely needs signifcant work and time.
