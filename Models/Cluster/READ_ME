Business provided hard locations for various specific facilites. (lat/long coordinates)
Using lat/long for clients, plot their closest facility and group accordingly. 
I have added the subway and bus stops on the MTA site (https://new.mta.info/developers)


Notes: 
I had issues with rivers and borders based on the data provided when approaching from a high level (all five boroughs), so I ended up creating the clustering by each borough 
and then bringing them all back in to have one large dataset. This also allowed me to approach outliers in a more detailed way for each borough. (Some lat/long for manhattan were in NJ) 
Then I was able to overlay the MTA stops with the clustering. 


Next Steps:
Bring in MTA API and show best travel routes for locations. Live feed is not needed but a best recommended route on usual circumstances refreshed is the current business goal.
This is to be put into an app for ease of use for our clients to see best routes.
