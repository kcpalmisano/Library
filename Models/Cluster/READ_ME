Business provided hard locations for COEs (Centers of Excellence) (lat/long)
Using home and work locations for members, plot their closest COE. 

I had issues with rivers and boarders based on the data provided, so I ended up creating by each borough 
and then bringing them all back in to have one large dataset. 


Next steps is to bring in MTA API and show best travel routes for locations. Live feed is not needed but a best recommended 
route on usual circumstances refreshed every day is the current business goal. This is to be put into our Member Portal for 
  ease of use for our members to see directly their best route.
