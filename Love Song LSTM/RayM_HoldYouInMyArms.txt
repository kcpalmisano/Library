When you came to me
With your bad dreams and your fears
It was easy to see you'd been crying
Seems like everywhere you turn
Catastrophe it reigns
But who really profits from the dying?
I could hold you in my arms
I could hold you forever
And I could hold you in my arms
Oh I could hold you forever
When you kissed my lips
With my mouth so full of questions
My worried mind that you quiet
Place your hands on my face
Close my eyes and say
That love is a poor man's food
Don't prophesize
I could hold you in my arms
I could hold you forever
And I could hold you in my arms
Oh I could hold you forever
So now we see how it is
This fist begets the spear
Weapons of war
Symptoms of madness
Don't let your eyes refuse to see
Don't let your ears refuse to hear
Or you ain't never going to shake
This sense of sadness
I could hold you in my arms
I could hold on forever
And I could hold you in my arms
Oh I could hold on forever
