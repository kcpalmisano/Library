Doesn't take much to make me happy
And make me smile with glee
Never never will I feel discouraged
'Cause our love's no mystery
Demonstrating love and affection
That you give so openly, yeah
I like the way you make me feel about you, baby
Want the whole wide world to see
you've got the best of my love
Goin' in and out of changes
The kind that come around each day
My life has a better meaning
Love has kissed me in a beautiful way
you've got the best of my love
Demonstrating sweet love and affection
That you give so openly, yeah
The way I feel about you, baby, can't explain it
Want the whole wide world to see
Oh, but in my heart you're all I need
You for me and me for you 
Oh yeah, it's growing everyday, baby 
you've got the best of my love
Oh, giving you the best of my love
My love
Oh, giving you the best of my love
you've got the best of my love
Oh, giving you the best of my love
