This wasn't supposed to happen
I was happy by myself
Accidentally you seduced me
I'm in love again
I lie in my bed, totally still
My eyes wide open, I'm in rapture
I don't believe this, I'm in love again
This wasn't supposed to happen
I've been hit with your charm
How could you do this to me?
I'm in love again
I lie in my bed, totally still
My eyes wide open, I'm in rapture
I don't believe this, I'm in love again
This wasn't supposed to happen
This wasn't supposed to happen
A small story which never happened
I said ouch! This really hurts
That can't be this has been
Practiced for millions of years
Therefore we are
Yes, but I, I'm a boy
A small story which always happens
I said ouch! This really hurts
This could well be
But this has
Been practiced for millions of years
Therefore we are
Yes, but, you're a girl
I lie in my bed, totally still
My eyes wide open, I'm in rapture
I don't believe this, I'm in love again
This wasn't supposed to happen
I lie in my bed, totally still
My eyes wide open, I'm in rapture
You've put a seed inside me
And while you're away
It's growing silently
Starts in my stomach 
Embraces my insides
And about to reach my heart
This wasn't supposed to happen
