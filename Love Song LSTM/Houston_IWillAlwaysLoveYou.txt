If I should stay
I would only be in your way
So I'll go, but I know
I'll think of you every step of the way
And I
Will always love you, you
You, my darling, you, mm
Bittersweet memories
That is all I'm taking with me
So goodbye, please don't cry
We both know I'm not what you, you need
And I
Will always love you, ooh, I
I hope life treats you kind
And I hope you have all you've dreamed of
And I'm wishing you joy and happiness
But above all this, I wish you love
And I, 
Will always love you
I will always love you
You, darling, I love you
Ooh, I'll always love you
