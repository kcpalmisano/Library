It doesn't hurt me 
Do you wanna feel how it feels? 
Do you wanna know, know that it doesn't hurt me? 
Do you wanna hear about the deal that I'm makin'? 
You
It's you and me
And if I only could
I'd make a deal with God
And I'd get him to swap our places
Be runnin' up that road
Be runnin' up that hill
Be runnin' up that buildin'
Say, if I only could, oh
You don't wanna hurt me 
But see how deep the bullet lies 
Unaware, I'm tearin' you asunder 
Oh, there is thunder in our hearts 
Is there so much hate for the ones we love? 
Oh, tell me, we both matter, don't we?
You
It's you and me
It's you and me, won't be unhappy
And if I only could
I'd make a deal with God
And I'd get him to swap our places
Be runnin' up that road
Be runnin' up that hill
Be runnin' up that buildin' 
Say, if I only could, oh
You 
It's you and me
It's you and me, won't be unhappy 
Oh, come on, baby 
Oh, come on, darlin' 
Let me steal this moment from you now
Oh, come on, angel
Come on, come on, darlin'
Let's exchange the experience 
Say, if I only could
I'd make a deal with God
And I'd get him to swap our places
I'd be runnin' up that road
Be runnin' up that hill
With no problems
