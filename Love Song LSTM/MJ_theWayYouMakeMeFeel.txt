Hey, pretty baby with the high heels on
You give me fever like I've never ever known
You're just a product of loveliness
I like the groove of your walk, your talk, your dress
I feel your fever from miles around
I'll pick you up in my car and we'll paint the town
Just kiss me baby and tell me twice
That you're the one for me
The way you make me feel
You really turn me on 
You knock me off of my feet 
My lonely days are gone 
I like the feelin' you're givin' me
Just hold me, baby, and I'm in ecstasy
Oh, I'll be workin' from nine to five
To buy you things to keep you by my side
I never felt so in love before
Just promise, baby, you'll love me forevermore
I swear I'm keepin' you satisfied
'Cause you're the one for me
The way you make me feel 
You really turn me on 
You knock me off of my feet now, baby 
My lonely days are gone 
Go on, girl!
I never felt so in love before
Promise, baby, you'll love me forevermore
I swear I'm keepin' you satisfied
'Cause you're the one for me
