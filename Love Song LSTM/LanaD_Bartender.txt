All the ladies of the canyon
Wearin' black to the house parties
Crosby, Stills and Nash is playin'
Wine is flowin' with Bacardi
But sometimes girls just want to have fun
The poetry inside of me is warm like a gun
I bought me a truck in the middle of the night
It'll buy me a year if I play my cards right
Photo free exits from baby's bedside
'Cause they don't yet know what car I drive
I'm just tryna keep my love alive
With my bartender, hold me all night
Bartender, our love's alive
Baby, remember, I'm not drinkin' wine
But that Cherry Coke you serve is fine
And our love's sweet enough on the vine
Bartender
All the ladies of the canyon
Wearin' white for their tea parties
Playing games of levitation
Meditatin' in the garden
And I love the little games that we play
From the valley to the beach
And when at last the day is done
I grab my keys
I bought me a truck in the middle of the night
It'll buy me a year if I play my cards right
Photo free exits from baby's bedside
'Cause they don't yet know what car I drive
I'm just tryna keep my love alive
With my bartender, hold me all night
Bartender, our love's alive
Baby, remember, I'm not drinkin' wine
But that Cherry Coke you serve is fine
And our love's sweet enough on the vine
Bartender
I bought me a truck in the middle of the night
60 MPH on PCH drive
Head to Long Beach to Newport by your side
As they don't yet know where I reside
60 miles from the last place I hide
With my bar-t-t-tender, hold me all night
Bartender, keep love alive
