cherish
So tired of broken hearts and losing at this game
Before I start this dance
I take a chance in telling you
I want more than just romance
You are my destiny
I can't let go, baby, can't you see?
Cupid, please take your aim at me
Cherish the thought
Of always having you here by my side
Oh baby, I cherish the joy
You keep bringing it into my life
I'm always singing it, cherish your strength
You got the power to make me feel good
And baby, I perish the thought
Of ever leaving, I never would
I was never satisfied with casual encounters
I can't hide my need
For two hearts that bleed
With burning love
That's the way it's got to be
Romeo and Juliet, they never felt this way I bet
So don't underestimate my point of view
Cherish the thought
Of always having you here by my side
Oh baby, I cherish the joy
You keep bringing it into my life
I'm always singing it, cherish your strength
You got the power to make me feel good
And baby, I perish the thought
Of ever leaving, I never would
Can't get away, I won't let you
I could never forget to
Cherish is the word I use to remind me of your love
Romeo and Juliet, they never felt this way I bet
So don't underestimate my point of view
Cherish the thought
Of always having you here by my side
Oh baby, I cherish the joy
You keep bringing it into my life
I'm always singing it, cherish your strength
You got the power to make me feel good
And baby, I perish the thought
Of ever leaving, I never would
Cherish
Give me faith
Give me joy, my boy
I will always cherish you
Cherish your strength 
You're giving it to me, boy 
I could never forget to
Keep giving me all your joy 
Cherish the thought
