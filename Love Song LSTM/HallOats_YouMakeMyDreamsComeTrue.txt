What I want, you've got and it might be hard to handle
But like a flame that burns the candle, the candle feeds the flame

Well, you

You 
Well you
Oh yeah, you make my dreams come true
On a night when bad dreams become a screamer
When they're messing with the dreamer, I can laugh it in the face
Twist and shout my way out and wrap yourself around me
'Cause I ain't the way you found me and I'll never be the same
Well, well, well, you
You make my dreams come true
You 
Well, you
You make my dreams come true
You
Well, listen to this

Well, well, well, you
You make my dreams come true
