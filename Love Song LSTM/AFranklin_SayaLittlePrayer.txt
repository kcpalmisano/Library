The moment I wake up
Before I put on my makeup makeup
I say a little prayer for you
While combing my hair now
I'm wondering what to wear now wear now
I say a little prayer for you for you, ooh
Oh, baby
ever
You'll stay in my heart and I will love you
Forever forever and ever ever
We never will part, oh, how I love you
Together togethеr together togethеr
That's how it must be to live without you
Would only mean heartbreak for me
I run for the bus, dear
While riding, I think of us, dear us, dear, hey
I say a little prayer for you, oh, shawty
At work, I just take time
And all through my coffee breaktime breaktime
I say a little prayer for you
forever
You'll stay in my heart and I will love you
Forever forever and ever ever
We never will part, oh, how I love you
Together together together together
That's how it must be to live without you
Would only mean heartbreak for me
Only mean heartbreak for me
Ooh-ooh
