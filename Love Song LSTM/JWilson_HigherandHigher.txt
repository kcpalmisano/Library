Your love, lifting me higher
Than I've ever been lifted before
So keep it it up
Quench my desire
And I'll be at your side, forever more
You know your love 
Keep on lifting
Higher 
I said your love 
Keep on 
Lifting me 
Higher and higher 
Listen
Now once, I was down-hearted
Disappointment, was my closest friend
But then you, came and it soon departed
And you know he never
Showed his face again
That's why your love 
Keep on lifting 
Higher 
I said your love 
Keep on 
Lifting me 
Higher and higher 
Alright
I'm so glad, I've finally found you
Yes that one, in a million girls
And I whip, my loving arms around you, honey
I can stand up, and face the world
Let me tell ya, your love 
Keep on lifting 
Higher 
Higher and higher 
I said your love your love keeps lifting me
Keep on love keeps lifting me
Lifting me 
Higher and higher 
Now sock it to me
Hold me, you're my woman
Keep my love going
Higher and higher
I said keep on lifting
Lift me up mama
